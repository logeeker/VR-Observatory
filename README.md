# The Gaint Magellan Telescope(GMT) VR Model
---------------------------------------
The Giant Magellan Telescope will be one member of the next class of giant ground-based telescopes. It will be constructed in the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Commissioning of the telescope is scheduled to begin in 2024. 

The aim of this project is to establish a VR model for GMT, which allow users to experience the observatory with a VR headset before the construction of the real one even started. It can be used not only for promotion purpose but also as a tool to validate the design.
